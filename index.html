      <h1>Student Profile: <strong>Ryan Gooding</strong></h1>
      <p>My name is Ryan Gooding. I am a third-year student here at Acadia. My major is
        software development. My favorite part of my degree is learning about how computers are built
        and how humans can interact with them.</p>
      <p>When I finish school, I plan to get a job in computer science, but not permanently. I want to use the funds from that
        job to fund my real business, which is becoming an online fitness coach.</p>
