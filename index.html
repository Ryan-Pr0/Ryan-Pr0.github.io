  <h2>Student Profile: <strong>Ryan Gooding</strong></h2>
  <p>My name is Ryan Gooding. I am a third year student here at acadia. 
  My major is software development. My favorite part of my degree is learning about how computers are built
  and how humans can interact with them.</p>
  <p>When I finish school I plan to get a job in computer science, but not permanently.
  I want to use the funds from that job to fund my real business which is becoming an online fitness coach.
  I enjoy going to the gym and seeing my body transform!</p>
